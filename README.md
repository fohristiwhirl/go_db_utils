# gogod_utils
Some helpers for the Games of Go on Download collection

* Create a database of the games with `gogod_db_creator.py` (requires [gofish](https://github.com/fohristiwhirl/gofish))
* Search the database with `searcher.pyw`

For best results, some constants at the top of `searcher.pyw` should be modified.
