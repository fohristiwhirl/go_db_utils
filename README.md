# go_db_utils
Some helpers for managing a database of Go games. (Currently I have GoGoD and Go4Go, and use Sabaki as my SGF editor; the scripts here reflect all that, but some minor alterations could be made to tailor it for your use.)

* Create a database of the games with `go_db_creator.py` (requires [gofish](https://github.com/fohristiwhirl/gofish))
* Search the database with `searcher.pyw`
